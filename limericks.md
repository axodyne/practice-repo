What is a limerick, anyway?

Limerick poems follow a strict structure: five lines, in which the first, second and fifth lines are longer and rhyme, while the third and fourth lines are shorter and share a separate rhyme (you may see this rhyme structure referred to as “AABBA”). There is often unusual stress in recitation, with emphasis placed on every other word starting with the second one. The humor usually comes in the final line, with a sudden reversal or twist, wordplay or twisted rhyme. When Lear was writing, the last line was often the same as the first apart from this twist, but this is no longer the popular form.
Common limerick formats

Limerick poems follow repeated patterns. They often open with lines such as, “There once was a (someone) from (somewhere) …” or “There was a (someone) who (something) …” One of the most famous opening lines is: “There once was a man from Nantucket …” That limerick was written by a Princeton professor and appeared in the college’s humorous newspaper, the Princeton Tiger, in 1902. Here it is in its entirety:
There are other examples too:
There was a Young Lady whose chin,
Resembled the point of a pin:
So she had it made sharp,
And purchased a harp,
And played several tunes with her chin.
